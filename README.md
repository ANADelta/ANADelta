## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Data Barber by Day â€” Compliance Ninja by Night.
I clean datasets like I clean lineups â€” sharp, structured, and built for impact.

Working at the intersection of AI, Data Compliance, and Creative Problem-Solving.

Tools of the trade: Python, VS Code, Jupyter, MongoDB, FiftyOne, Hugging Face â€” and a good pair of clippers.

Here to build clean pipelines, clean documentation, and clean fades.
